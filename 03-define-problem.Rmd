# Define the Problem or Question {-#define-problem}

**"Extra time to craft a concise yet comprehensive and accurate problem definition pays off..."**  - Smart Choices

The desired state of a pROC is a decision framed around our values, and as such, the "problem" with the pROC is actually a decision as well. Since we have already decided that a pROC is important, then there must be underlying reasons for this decision. Why is the pROC important? What is the question about the pROC that needs to be addressed? Fully answering these questions is arguably one of the most important steps in the survey development process because without this information, we can produce a I&M program that does not address the fundamental information need. 

This step will involve a focused dialogue (workshop) to clarify and document the importance of resource, the vision of success given perfect information, the geographic scope, who has authority to make decisions that could resolve the issue, constraints (legal, financial, and political), desired information to improve decision-making, and the stakeholders interested in or impacted by the decision. 

Things to consider include:

## Importance of the Resource {-#resource-importance}
A priority resource of concern is, by definition, of importance to a refuge. This step involves specifying what makes the pROC important. If a refuge has recently gone through the ROC prioritization process, then there will already be a list of criteria that was used to evaluate it's relative importance. These criteria could be used to inform this step.

## Vision of Success {-#vision-success}


## Scope {-#scope}
How large, broad or complicated is the problem and the decision? What is the geographic scope of interest?

## Frequency and Timing {-frequency-timing}
When and how often does a decision need to be made about the pROC?


## Stakeholders {-#stakeholders}
Who are the people that are affected by the problem or can influence the decision?

## Authority {-#authority}
Who is able to make decisions that could address the problem?

## Constraints {-#constraints}
Are there any legal, political or financial constraints? Perceived or real?
