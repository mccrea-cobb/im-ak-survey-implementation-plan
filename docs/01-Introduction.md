# Introduction

## Problem Statement 

The Alaska I&M team needs a transparent, defensible, consistent and detailed process for developing and documenting SMART management objectives for priority Resources of Concern and completing Inventory and Monitoring Plans for each of 9 Alaska refuge complexes by September 2023 that clearly fits into an adaptive management framework.   

## Objectives 

What are the goals of refuge planning? … To provide a basis for adaptive management by monitoring progress, evaluating plan implementation, and updating refuge plans accordingly. – 602 FW 1 

Below are a list of objectives for the I&M Planning team.  Objectives with a (*) crosswalk with our I&M Strategic Plan. 

- Strategic:  Improve natural resource management decision-making for Alaska National Wildlife Refuges while building scientific knowledge for future management decision challenges.  Decisions include selecting priority resources, setting management objectives, identifying information needs, selecting natural resource surveys and identifying management actions. 
- Fundamental: Maximize the transparency of the decision-making process and associated products. 

    - Strategy: Use SDM to guide decision making 

    - Strategy: Use conceptual models to illustrate complexity  

    - Strategy: Inform management decisions with data and evidence 

 
- Fundamental: Maximize the probability that decisions and products will be updated in response to new information. 

    - Strategy: Use SHC guidance/adaptive management framework 

 
- Fundamental: Maximize the rigor of natural resource plans (e.g., draft NRMPs, IMPs).* 

  - Means: MakeMaximize use of existing refuge survey data, scientific literature, etc. 

  - Strategy: Consider species pROC ecology (e.g., habitat needs and drivers)  

  - Strategy: Create strong connections between survey data and management objectives 

  - Means: Maximize  use of current our understanding of the impacts of key threats or stressors on refuge species and ecosystems, especially climate change as part of the planning process.* 

 - Fundamental: Increase the number of refuges that have documented SMART wildlife and ecosystem management objectives.*  

  - Means: Maximize the efficiency of the decision-making process (i.e., meet Chief’s Challenge deadline of IMPs by Sept 2023). 

  - Means: Minimize employee time  

  - Means: Maximize use of employee resources and expertise  

    - Strategy: Use technical tools (R-markdown, Shiny apps, etc.) 

  - Means:  Maximize the accessibility of products and data to internal and external audiences.* 

    - Strategy:  Follow FWS data management best practices
