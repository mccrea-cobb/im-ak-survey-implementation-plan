# Develop Results Chains {-#results-chains}

For each management action identified, we will develop “results chains” that specify how the action is expected to influence the state of the pROC relative to the conservation goal. It specifies, through a series of cause-and-effect statements, how we think the system will change if action is implemented.  Through this process we may identify intermediate outcomes and associated means objectives that will help us determine if our action is effective.
