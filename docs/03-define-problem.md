# Define the Problem or Question {-#define-problem}

Why is the pROCs important? What is the question that needs to be addressed? Fully answering these questions is arguably one of the most important steps in the survey development process because without this information, we can produce a I&M program that does not address the fundamental information need. 

This step will involve a focused dialogue (workshop) to clarify and document the importance of resource, the vision of success given perfect information, the geographic scope, who has authority to make decisions that could resolve the issue, constraints (legal, financial, and political), desired information to improve decision-making, and the stakeholders interested in or impacted by the decision. 

## Importance of the Resource {-#resource-importance}
A priority resource of concern is, by definition, of importance to a refuge. This step involves specifying what makes the pROC important. If a refuge has recently gone through the ROC prioritization process, then there will already be a list of criteria that was used to evaluate it's relative importance. These criteria could be used to inform this step.
