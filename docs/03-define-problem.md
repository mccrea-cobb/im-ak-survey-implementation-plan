# Define the Problem or Question {-#define-problem}

**"Extra time to craft a concise yet comprehensive and accurate problem definition pays off..."**  - Smart Choices

The desired state of a [priority resource of concern] ([pROC]) is a decision framed around our values, and as such, the "problem" with the pROC is actually a decision as well. Since we have already decided that a pROC is important, then there must be underlying reasons for this decision. Why is the pROC important? What is the question about the pROC that needs to be addressed? Fully answering these questions is arguably one of the most important steps in the survey development process because without this information, we can produce a I&M program that does not address the fundamental information need. 

This step will involve a focused dialogue (workshop) to clarify and document the importance of resource, the vision of success given perfect information, the geographic scope, who has authority to make decisions that could resolve the issue, constraints (legal, financial, and political), desired information to improve decision-making, and the stakeholders interested in or impacted by the decision. 

Things to consider include:

##### Importance of the Resource {-#resource-importance}
A [pROC] is, by definition, important to a refuge. In defining the problem, we specify what makes the pROC important. This might have already been done if a refuge has recently gone through the resource of concern prioritization process. If that is the case, you can use the list of criteria that was used to evaluate it's relative importance.

##### Vision of Success {-#vision-success}  
Imagine a hypothetical situation where you had a complete understand of the pROC. What does this look like? What is the state of the pROC? 

##### Scope {-#scope}
How large, broad or complicated is the problem and the decision? What is the geographic scope of interest?

##### Frequency and Timing {-#frequency}
How often does a decision need to be made about the pROC?

##### Timing {-#timing}
When does a decision need to be made about the pROC?

##### Stakeholders {-#stakeholders}
Who are the individuals or groups that have a stake in the outcome of the management decision?

##### Authority {-#authority}
Who is able to make decisions that could address the problem?

##### Constraints {-#constraints}
Are there any legal, political or financial constraints? Perceived or real?
