# State the Goal {-#state-goal}

Developing a clear and meaningful goal is a critical step in the decision-making process. Doing so will reduce the likelihood of not addressing all the stakeholders values and overlooking hidden objectives that could later unknowingly influence the process. 

In this step, the team will draft a goal statement for the pROC. This will be completed in a workshop setting, often combined with the [Defining the Problem][define-problem] step. The [goal] statement is equivalent to a Fundamental Objective in Structured Decision-making. It is defined as a “a descriptive, open-ended, and often broad statement of desired future conditions that conveys a purpose, but does not define measurable units” ([Writing Refuge Management Goals and Objectives: A Handbook](https://www.fws.gov/refuges/policiesandbudget/pdfs/writingrefugegoals_022504.pdf)). It is visionary, not [SMART];  it’s what we care about “just because” and it captures our values by making clear connections between a refuge’s vision and CCP goals/objectives.
