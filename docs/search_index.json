[["introduction.html", "Introduction Objectives The Steps", " Introduction Decisions require the integration of science with values, because in the end any decision is an attempt to achieve some future condition that is desirable to the decision maker.  Runge et al. 2013 This guide describes a transparent, defensible, consistent, and detailed process for developing and documenting SMART management objectives for priority Resources of Concern and completing Inventory and Monitoring Plans for refuge complexes that clearly fits into an adaptive management framework. Objectives The goal of refuge planning is to provide a basis for adaptive management by monitoring progress, evaluating plan implementation, and updating refuge plans accordingly (602 FW 1). Below are a list of objectives for the Alaska I&amp;M Planning team. Strategic: Improve natural resource management decision-making for Alaska National Wildlife Refuges while building scientific knowledge for future management decision challenges. Decisions include selecting priority resources, setting management objectives, identifying information needs, selecting natural resource surveys and identifying management actions. Fundamental: Maximize the transparency of the decision-making process and associated products. Strategy: Use SDM to guide decision making Strategy: Use conceptual models to illustrate complexity Strategy: Inform management decisions with data and evidence Fundamental: Maximize the probability that decisions and products will be updated in response to new information. Strategy: Use SHC guidance/adaptive management framework Fundamental: Maximize the rigor of natural resource plans (e.g., draft NRMPs, IMPs).* Means: MakeMaximize use of existing refuge survey data, scientific literature, etc. Strategy: Consider species pROC ecology (e.g., habitat needs and drivers) Strategy: Create strong connections between survey data and management objectives Means: Maximize use of current our understanding of the impacts of key threats or stressors on refuge species and ecosystems, especially climate change as part of the planning process.* Fundamental: Increase the number of refuges that have documented SMART wildlife and ecosystem management objectives.* Means: Maximize the efficiency of the decision-making process (i.e., meet Chiefs Challenge deadline of IMPs by Sept 2023). Means: Minimize employee time Means: Maximize use of employee resources and expertise Strategy: Use technical tools (R-markdown, Shiny apps, etc.) Means: Maximize the accessibility of products and data to internal and external audiences.* Strategy: Follow FWS data management best practices The Steps To meet this objective, this guide outlines a process that includes a number of steps.
