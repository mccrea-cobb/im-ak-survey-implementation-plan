Runge et al. 2013 This guide describes a transparent, defensible, consistent, and detailed process for developing and documenting SMART management objectives for priority Resources of Concern and completing Inventory and Monitoring Plans for refuge complexes that clearly fits into an adaptive management framework. Objectives The goal of refuge planning is to provide a basis for adaptive management by monitoring progress, evaluating plan implementation, and updating refuge plans accordingly (602 FW 1). Below are a list of objectives for the Alaska I&amp;M Planning team. Strategic: Improve natural resource management decision-making for Alaska National Wildlife Refuges while building scientific knowledge for future management decision challenges. Decisions include selecting priority resources, setting management objectives, identifying information needs, selecting natural resource surveys and identifying management actions. Fundamental: Maximize thetransparency of the decision-making process and associated products. Strategy: Use SDM to guide decision making Strategy: Use conceptual models to illustrate complexity Strategy: Inform management decisions with data and evidence Fundamental: Maximize the probability that decisions and products will be updated in response to new information. Strategy: Use SHC guidance/adaptive management framework Fundamental: Maximize the rigor of natural resource plans (e.g., draft NRMPs, IMPs).* Means: MakeMaximize use of existing refuge survey data, scientific literature, etc. Strategy: Consider species pROC ecology (e.g., habitat needs and drivers) Strategy: Create strong connections between survey data and management objectives Means: Maximize use of current our understanding of the impacts of key threats or stressors on refuge species and ecosystems, especially climate change as part of the planning process.* Fundamental: Increase the number of refuges that have documented SMART wildlife and ecosystem management objectives.* Means: Maximize the efficiency of the decision-making process (i.e., meet Chiefs Challenge deadline of IMPs by Sept 2023). Means: Minimize employee time Means: Maximize use of employee resources and expertise Strategy: Use technical tools (R-markdown, Shiny apps, etc.) Means: Maximize the accessibility of products and data to internal and external audiences.* Strategy: Follow FWS data management best practices "],["select-proc.html", "Selecting a priority resource of concern", " Selecting a priority resource of concern Kristin Refuge staff will select one priority resource of concern (pROC) to move through the planning process and develop one-ROC IMPs. pROCs are defined as a resources of concern, selected by refuge staff during the ROC prioritization process, that have critical information needs and/or require management actions to conserve and are therefore the top candidates for associated survey development. The purpose of selecting one pROC is to increase the efficiency of moving through the planning process, increase scientific rigor of outcomes and, ultimately, increase the feasibility of refuge staff to be able to complete surveys. I&amp;M staff may assist refuges in selecting a pROC by providing guidance. As part of this step, we will also identify team members and their roles. "],["define-problem.html", "Define the Problem or Question", " Define the Problem or Question McCrea Extra time to craft a concise yet comprehensive and accurate problem definition pays off  Smart Choices The desired state of a priority resource of concern (pROC) is a decision framed around stakeholder values, and as such, the problem with the pROC is actually a decision as well. Since a refuge has already decided that a pROC is important, then there must be underlying reasons for this decision. Why is the pROC important? What is the question about the pROC that needs to be addressed? Fully answering these questions is arguably one of the most important steps in the survey development process because without this information, we can produce a I&amp;M program that does not address the fundamental information need. Framing the problem is often a surprisingly difficult step in the process. We recommend a focused dialogue (i.e., workshop) with team members identified in the [Selecting a pROC][select-proc] step to clarify and document the importance of pROC. As the process continues with later steps, the problem statement could evolve. Specific things to consider include: Importance Why is the state about the pROC important? What are the consequences of a poor decision? For example, is there a risk of legal action, extinction of a species or population, impacts to native resources, a loss of hunting opportunities, or not achieving an agency mandate or objective? A pROC is, by definition, important to a refuge. In this step, we specify what makes the pROC important. This information might be documented already if a refuge has recently gone through a recent ROC prioritization process. In this situation, feel free to use this information (the criteria) to evaluate the pROCs relative importance. Note that the importance of a pROC might be a mixture of quantitative criteria (e.g., species status or ecological role) and value judgment (e.g., public enjoyment or financial interest). Vision of Success Here we consider what success looks like. To do this, it can be helpful to imagine a hypothetical situation where you had a complete understand of the pROC. What does this situation look like? What is the state of the pROC? What attributes about the pROC did you consider in your vision? The Decision What is the decision to be made? What choice or choices does the team face? Scope How large, broad, or complicated is the problem and the decision about the pROC? What is the geographic scope of interest? It is important to frame the problem around this scope. If the scope extends beyond refuge boundaries, it could be valuable to add team members to represent the values of the pROC in this region (e.g., state and tribal biologists). If the scope is only a portion of the refuge, then the team can narrow the focus of the problem. Frequency How often does a decision need to be made about the pROC? Is there urgency to the decision or is there some flexibility? Timing When does a decision need to be made about the pROC? Is it a one-time or reoccurring decision? Are there stakeholders that would benefit from a decision on a regular interval? Is there a reoccurring event that demands a decision (e.g., Regional Advisory Committee meetings or Board of Game cycles). Stakeholders Who are the individuals or groups that have a stake in the outcome of the management decision? Authority Who is able to make decisions that could address the problem? Constraints Are there any legal, political or financial constraints? Perceived or real? "],["state-goal.html", "State the Goal", " State the Goal McCrea Developing a clear and meaningful goal is a critical step in the decision-making process. Doing so will reduce the likelihood of not addressing all the stakeholders values and overlooking hidden objectives that could later unknowingly influence the process. In this step, the team will draft a goal statement for the pROC. This will be completed in a workshop setting, often combined with the [Defining the Problem][define-problem] step. The goal statement is equivalent to a Fundamental Objective in Structured Decision-making. It is defined as a a descriptive, open-ended, and often broad statement of desired future conditions that conveys a purpose, but does not define measurable units (Writing Refuge Management Goals and Objectives: A Handbook). It is visionary, not SMART; its what we care about just because and it captures our values by making clear connections between a refuges vision and CCP goals/objectives. "],["concept-model.html", "Develop the Conceptual Model", " Develop the Conceptual Model Jared The team, with support from I&amp;M, will sketch out a conceptual model focused on factors that contribute to achieving the conservation goal of the pROC. The purpose of a conceptual model is to: Identify potential internal (e.g., vital rates) and external (e.g., environmental drivers, threats, and stressors) key components and management actions that might influence the conservation goal and illustrate the links between key components Increase transparency and communication Build consensus among the team members about how the system operates Identify uncertainties, knowledge gaps and competing hypotheses about how the system operates Provide a framework for a mathematical model Provide a framework for adaptive management (e.g., update the model as new survey data are collected) First, the team will gather relevant data and information, including literature, existing models, refuge data sources (reports, raw data). Then, the team will develop a conceptual model based on the pROC conservation goal. Model elements will include environmental and population drivers, threats and management actions. "],["math-model.html", "Develop the Mathematical Model", " Develop the Mathematical Model Jared The team, with support from I&amp;M Technical Team, will translate the conceptual model of the pROC system to a mathematical model and parameterize the model with values based on existing data, reported estimates, or solicited professional opinions. The purpose of the mathematical model is to: Represent our current understanding of the ecological functioning of the pROC in a quantifiable form, given its conservation and management context expressed through the fundamental objective Organize information for the pROC into a unified, transparent framework that facilitates rapid feedback of new information into management and survey decision making Identify key resource attributes and principal external drivers important to achieving the conservation goal for the pROC Identify candidate specific and measurable means objectives for key resource attributes necessary to achieve conservation goal Determine specific and measurable states or effects of principal external drivers necessary to achieve candidate means objectives If applicable, represent alternatives for a variety of decision problems in a quantifiable form that can be used to identify optimal decisions given predetermined constraints "],["mgt-objectives.html", "Write SMART Management Objectives", " Write SMART Management Objectives Jared The team, with support from I&amp;M Technical Team, will develop SMART management objectives based on the parameterized mathematical model of the ROC system. SMART management objectives are considered means objectives in that they are the means by which we achieve our fundamental objective (e.g., Conservation Goal) through management actions. However, management objectives may differ from broader means objectives (see above) that may not be achievable or results oriented in the typical context of SMART Refuge management objectives. For example, a means objective may be a minimum adult female survival probability of 0.9 to achieve the fundamental objective of maintaining a stable population (i.e., mean population growth rate = 1) for a particular wildlife species. If the current knowledge of moose populations shows survival is 0.75 and raising it to the means objective is not achievable, given management time constraints, then setting alternative means objectives that are achievable and have high likelihood of contributing to the broader means objective should be considered. The purpose of a SMART management objective: Specific: identifies a clearly defined resource attribute targeted by a specific management action. Measurable: defines the expected outcome of a specific management action with numerical values expressed in a mathematical statement. Achievable: communicates a practical management action that is feasible given the fundamental objective, possible other means objectives, and logistical and other decision constraints. Results-Oriented: presents clear expectations for the outcomes of proposed management actions contributing to the fundamental objective. Time-Limited: specifies start and end dates for initiation, implementation, completion, expected outcomes, and evaluation of management actions. "],["results-chains.html", "Develop Results Chains", " Develop Results Chains Jared For each management action identified, we will develop results chains that specify how the action is expected to influence the state of the pROC relative to the conservation goal. It specifies, through a series of cause-and-effect statements, how we think the system will change if action is implemented. Through this process we may identify intermediate outcomes and associated means objectives that will help us determine if our action is effective. "],["surveys.html", "Identify and Prioritize Surveys", " Identify and Prioritize Surveys (McCrea) Monitoring can play &gt;3 roles: to provide information necessary for state-dependent decision-making, to evaluate management performance, and to facilitate improved management through learning.  Nichols and Williams 2006 In this step, we will start to develop surveys that address the information needs identified through the management objectives. We will prioritize surveys based on their relative contributions to understanding the state of the conservation goal, identified by analyzing the mathematical model. This information will be recorded as a PRIMR record for each required survey. Specifically, we will identify: The attribute(s) of interest How the key attribute(s) will be measured and at what scale The object(s) to be measured The sampling frame (survey area) The sampling interval and survey timing The estimated annual cost and partners "],["document.html", "Document and Archive", " Document and Archive McCrea The final step will be to archive the data, products, and metadata generated from this effort in ServCat.
