# Identify and Prioritize Surveys {-#surveys}
(McCrea)

> "Monitoring can play >3 roles: to provide information necessary for state-dependent decision-making, to evaluate management performance, and to facilitate improved management through learning."  
> --- Nichols and Williams 2006

In this step, we will start to develop surveys that address the information needs identified through the management objectives. We will prioritize surveys based on their relative contributions to understanding the state of the conservation goal, identified by analyzing the mathematical model. This information will be recorded as a PRIMR record for each required survey. Specifically, we will identify: 

- The attribute(s) of interest 

- How the key attribute(s) will be measured and at what scale 
- The “object(s)” to be measured 
- The sampling frame (survey area) 
- The sampling interval and survey timing 
- The estimated annual cost and partners
